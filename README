NAME
    Auth::Krb5Afs - get Krb5 and OpenAFS tokens

SYNOPSIS
     use Auth::Krb5Afs;
     my ($err, $pwent) = Auth::Krb5Afs->authenticate($user, $pass);

DESCRIPTION
    invokes kinit and aklog to get Kerberos 5 and OpenAFS tickets

METHODS
    $auth = Auth::Krb5Afs->new();
        Create a new instance. You could also use
        Auth::Krb5Afs->authenticate() without an instance variable.

    ($err, $pwent) = $auth->authenticate($user, $pass);
        invokes "kinit" and "aklog" to get krb5 and afs tokens. By default,
        the krb5 ticket is good for 20 minutes, renewable up to 10 hours.

        If successful, sets the USER, HOME, and SHELL environment variables,
        the current uid and gid, and chdirs to HOME.

        In an array context, returns an array ref to the result from
        getpwuid($afs_uid).

        In a scalar context, returns error strings in a hash like
        $err->{pass} = "unknown user or wrong password";

TESTING
    The bin/authkrb5afs program behaves like one of courier's authlib
    modules. It reads password etc from file descriptor 3, then invokes the
    rest of its command line as the user.

     printf 'imap\nlogin\ntest_user\ntest_pass\n' |
